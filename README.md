# Frampton

Frampton is a functional library written for ES5. Older browsers will require a shim.

Frampton is written with the opinion that reactive programming is best suited for modeling the user interactions we deal with in the browser. As such it provides an Observable implementation that should be familiar to anyone who has experience with Bacon or RxJS.
